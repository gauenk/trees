742	1	Literally, this place has the best burger I've eaten in my entire life. So good I went two days in a row. I make it a point to come here every time I visit Vegas.   Only problem, which I can't dock stars for nor would I, this place is only in Vegas. Please please please open up a restaurant in LA!
529	1	WOW What can i say about this place other than it was amazing! I ordered the chill omelette which was amazing and it comes with potatoes. Also the banana nut muffin comes with this and this muffin was probably this best muffin i have ever had. The service was great even with the place being busy. Just a heads up your gonna have to wait especially on weekiends, it was definitely worth the wait and i will be back here every time I am in Vegas.
1239	1	5 star service from beginning to end.  The waiters took great care of us, helped answer all of our questions, and were incredibly knowledgeable.  You're going to pay a great deal, but it's a great meal and experience.  The steaks were cooked perfectly, the drinks were great, and the sides were amazing! Be ready to drop a great deal of money, but when you're in Vegas and with a name like Gordon Ramsay attached to it, you know what you're getting into.
505	1	Wanted a special dinner with my beautiful BAE so I made reservations on Open Table. After watching Frozen Fury (LA Kings destroyed the Colorado Avalanche) we took a Uber to the Paris Hotel.  Our table was located upstairs. We had Matthew and Tony for our waiters. Our appetizers were the Gnocchi, Sriracha Roasted Broccoli and the Mac & Cheese. All three were delicious. As you can imagine the presentations were top notch.  Our main entrees were the 8 oz. Filet for me and the American Rib Cap for her. Amazing pieces of beef.   This was my first visit to a Gordon Ramsay restaurant. I love his shows (Master Chef, Hell's Kitchen, Kitchen Nightmares) and now I can save I love his food. Can't wait to visit another one of his establishments.
1340	1	I just love it here!  The food is delicious, the servers are friendly, and the atmosphere is great!  It's perfect for curing your hangover or stopping in to fill up your tummy when trying to prevent one.  Don't forget the milkshakes...mmmmm!  The only bad thing about it is that I don't live in LV so I can't go as often as I would like!
951	0	As soon as we walked in our room, the toilet was running constantly and would not flush. We called the front desk and waited an hour and nobody answered us. We decided to head out for a bit and when we got back we called the front desk again, waited a while and someone finally answered. We asked if we could change rooms and they said no. They said they would send a repair guy to fix the toilet, they did not apologize for the inconvenience.  When we got back that night the toilet was fixed. But the next morning as i went to take a nice shower, i could hardly keep my balance because there was water stuck under the bottom of the tub lining. I slipped a couple of times and so did my boyfriend. I can only imagine how much it must be rotting under there. There were also hand towels on top of the bathroom door and shower rod that were hard as a rock... Who knows how long they were there for.  Not to mention the sleepless nights because of young kids hanging out in the hallway, smoking and drinking and yelling for hours. Will NEVER stay there again.
1045	0	This is the first, and hopefully the last, 1 star review I posted on here.  First off, there is a sign right in front of the Buffet that says some prices in very large writing, so when you walk by the sign you think that is the 'real' prices (i think it says 17.99 during the week and 21.99 for the weekend).  But you have to look at the small print and see that it is on for 'to go' orders.  That threw us off right off the bat.  The real price is $31.00.  So they suckered us in with that sign and i wasn't happy about that.    Second, the food was blahhh.  Pretty much what you can get at a $9.99 buffet anywhere.  Some of the better things they had were all gone and when i asked how long it would take to cook them and for them to be available they told me 5 minutes.  15 minutes later they still weren't ready.  Plenty of other buffets to try in Vegas, dont waste your time on this one.
415	1	Every trip to Vegas, it is a MUST for us to stop here and eat! This place is AMAZING, everything on the menu is worth trying....  Now, the service.... if I could offer Carol Anne 20 stars, I WOULD! She is super sweet, always with a smile. We are a large family....11 of us!!! Some waiters/waitresses don't like or fear a large crowd...but she took us all with the biggest smile ever!!!!  it's service like that, that makes this delicious experience....PERFECT!!!
1334	1	With over 2,000 reviews, I am not sure that there is much that I can add.  But I do want to make one suggestion to Yelpers:  Please, please, PLEASE look at the Northern Thai section of the menu.  While the rest of the menu is very, very good (especially loved the Garlic Prawns and Sea Bass on Drunken noodles), the Northern Thai section offers dishes that you won't find at most Thai restaurants.  We had two standouts, both based on recommendations of our very attentive waiter.  The first was Kang Ka Noon, which is jackfruit in a spicy curry sauce.  An article on NPR says that these are the largest tree fruit in the world, reaching up to 100 lbs each, and high in protein, potassium, and vitamin B2 (and yes, they are quite an interesting looking fruit).  However, when it is cut up and put into a dish, the jackfruit has the consistency of an artichoke heart.  Smooth, creamy and delicious.  And the curry sauce adds the perfect spice to balance the simple sweetness of the fruit.  The second dish was Khao Soi, a curried, egg noodle dish (with Burmese flavor influences) that we had with chicken.  Much like Pho has its salad accompaniment, so does Khao Soi:  onions, mustard greens, and lime.  Oh my goodness was this dish fantastic.  It was clearly the hit of the night.  So if you are an adventurous foodie (and you likely are if you are reading reviews in Yelp), step away from the traditional and go right for the Northern part of the menu.  You will not be sorry.
1534	1	Lisa was fantastic! Everything about this place is fantastic.   Service  Attentive quick. Within fave minutes drink was served and with in ten food is served. Just right amount of check ups and right after we finished the bill and Togo box is served.   Good  Ordered the works omelette and beef hash, with muffins and potatoes as sides. The banana muffins are simply amazing. I'm not a big fan of baked goods but the muffins are something else.   The potatoes tastes like squared fries and delightfully crispy. The actual omelette and the beef hash are tasty with just the right amount of seasoning.   Did I mention bottomless coffee? Omg this place have everything! This will be my new favorite spot when I come to Vegas
921	1	I finally made it back to Bouchon and this time for brunch. It was the best breakfast I had on this trip...er, although I as subject to convention food breakfast, so relatively speaking it honestly doesn't take much to be a best breakfast.  That's not to say the food was bad. No, it was very very good.  Our waiter, whose name I do not recall sadly, led us through some recommendations that we were very happy with.  * Sweetbreads to start. Mmm, glands. It was on the specials chalkboard. * Pan roasted trout, piled with vegetables. With clear eyes on the fish head. Fresh! * Chicken and waffles. Yummy. Is it really French? Do I care?  And lots of coffee.   Definitely the priciest of breakfasts, and worth it.  We admired the selection of absinthe at the bar, and also the good beers on tap.   I couldn't really feel any "food magic" in the space. It felt like the typical good food decadence I feel in the strip area of Vegas.  But if I can walk into a restaurant, see the food I'm eating, and dine without hearing the endless bings and bonks of casino machines, I'm pretty happy. Service and food can't be faulted for anything, for my experience. But I was bummed that the people at two small tables nearby me seemed unhappy. One duo effectively dined alone, as their food arrived 15 minutes apart and there was never a time they had food together on the table. Another, um, gererously portioned couple seemed unhappy with the size of their meals.  Since casinos are probably not very far away from handing out collectible feed sacks to strap to our faces in the buffets, I leave it to the latter couple to sort out what best meets their dining expectations.  For the former, the management came and resolved the issue as best they could and I admire the duo for leaving the waiter a very generous tip, as the timing of the food preparation was not his fault.  I've done a dinner here, as well as a brunch. It was very good, but I probably don't need to return for a meal. Bouchon has kind of blown its wad and I don't get the impression that an encore is necessary. Maybe for some absinthe, or a pastry from the bakery.
316	0	If I could give this place a zero, then I would. This was the most HORRIBLE dining experience that I've ever had. It is no surprise that they continue to move their business page!  Our cousins invited us to stay with them at their fantastic timeshare and we wanted to show our appreciation by taking them to a nice dinner. Earlier that day, I passed by Pampas and a hostess in front of the restaurant offered me a coupon. It was a buy one get one free offer. I inquired about the price difference between lunch and dinner, and asked that she explain what we should expect to get based on when what time we decide to eat. She told me that the main difference is that there would be 7 meat selections for lunch and 12 meat selections for dinner. We were all excited and looking forward to our dinner. It was a Sunday night, and we were sat right away. This was the only good thing about this night, no wait for a table, but here's the rest of our infuriating debacle. Our server, Karen, approached us a few minutes after we were sat and brought over a couple of large bottles of water. The caps were already removed from the bottle so we assumed that they were trying to be creative in how they served water. We later found out that they CHARGED US FOR WATER! We did not request water to begin with. She should have informed us that there was a charge before placing it on our table. Also, as you'll see on the attached picture that the bottle states that sparkling water is served in the bottle, but it was NOT sparkling at all. I asked Karen why they charged for water that we did not ask for and she said "Nevada has the worst tap water in all of United States, and I would never drink it." Obviously, her reply did not answer my question as to why they charge for something prior to informing us of the charge. BTW, it a minimal charge, but it's the principle.  Karen informed us that our coupon required that we buy a drink, so she goes on to suggest that we buy a pitcher of some type of alcoholic drink. I asked her if the coupon required that the drink be an alcoholic drink, and her response was "Well this is Vegas!" WTH!!! This girl was so irritating. I informed her that my husband did not drink alcohol, and she gave us a look of disgust. What she doesn't know is that it was only my husband who preferred non-alcoholic drinks, and the remaining 3 people would have ordered a bunch of alcoholic drinks, but the look that she gave automatically triggered us to order only the cheapest non-alcoholic drinks (with refills). Time to eat! The salad bar was horrible. It looked as if workers do not check the area to keep it clean. Totally looked unsanitary. Karen claimed there were 40 different types of food at the salad bar, and that was a totally false statement.  The meat options were horrible!!! I was already irritated by Karen's lies and up sales, so it triggered me to keep track of the number of meat options and again ... caught them in a lie! At the most, they only had 6-7 meat options that night for dinner. We asked Karen twice and another worker once if they can bring out lamb and they kept saying it was on its way. It NEVER came out to our table and we noted that it was not ever offered to anyone else. MORE LIES AND DECIT. They were charging us dinner prices for the same lunch options. They could have simply admitted that they did not have the lamb that we requested.  STAY AWAY from this place but if you're brave enough to try it, make sure that your server is not Karen, so that you'll hopefully have a more pleasurable dining experience. Karen's level of unprofessionalism left such a poor impression.
1747	0	We sat inside because we didn't want to bake in the July Las Vegas sun, but the patio would be good for people watching.  Inside the music was too loud and while our server was nice, it took a while to get our drinks and food.  I had the carnitas tacos for a late lunch which were pretty tasty, but the meal was small.  The place is pricey especially for drinks.   Luckily I had the Yelp check-in offer for a free house margarita that the wife enjoyed.
1012	0	I am not sure if it is the fact that this Lee's Sandwich is located in Las Vegas, that the owners feel compelled to follow the lead of other well-known and loved California-based eateries (i.e., Pinks Hotdog, Sam Woos) that set up shop here, by jacking up the price and cutting back on what it serves.  At least that is what I think after visiting Lee's post their officially grand opening.  Sandwiches still taste the same, except you just get less of everything that goes in between the fresh baked baguette (meat, pickled radish and carrots and even cilantro and slices of chilie).  Iced coffee still tastes great, except you get more ice than coffee.  Even if you ask for less ice, you will get less ice but also a cup that is not full (imagine an inch of nothing to top of your plastic cup).  Anyway, the place is new and very nice looking.  Staff is still trying to master the sandwich menu, so I am sure eventually they will get faster with fulfilling the orders.  But unless they start to serve what we can get normally at all the other Lee's sandiwch shops up and down California, potential customers are better off patronizing other local banh mi shops.  And there are quite a few of them just a few blocks down Spring Mountain Rd.  I wish I can like this Lee's Sandwich more, but after a few visits I am too disappointed to want to go back.  As it stands, I feel that this Lee's is trying to set the bar extremely low for what customers should expect from this location, perhaps not realizing that a vast majority of the patrons have had the Lee's experience from California prior to visiting this one.  I can only guess that as a new food service operator in Las Vegas, they failed to do any sort of market or demographic analysis and/or extremely ignorant of the commonsense knowledge that roughly 50% of the visitors that come to LV are visiting from CA (land of the Lee's Sandwiches).  So we will see how well they fare after the novelty wears out, because without a course correction I see only iceberg ahead for this Titanic of a Lee's Sandwich.  (UPDATE) - From David Y: A worker told him to ask for "less ice and more coffee" when ordering their Lee's Iced Coffee, otherwise the future lawyers fulfilling the orders behind the counter will do exactly as the customer requested. How knew ordering a effing cup of the common Vietnamese Iced Coffee is the stepping stone to studying for the LSAT.
1687	1	This location is really convenient if you're done with class and want to settle for some good food and cheap beers. This is also located near the Kiss mini putt putt if you're trying to take someone on a cheap date.   I definitely receive my money's worth here, especially for it being a non AYCE Korean BBQ restaurant. The service is fast and friendly. The food is consistently delicious and you really can't beat the happy hour deals. I actually spent less money here for two people than if we were to go to any other AYCE. The pork belly and bulgolgi are really tender and even with a slight char from the grill, they never got overcooked.
254	1	About my fifth or sixth visit here, has never disappointed. This time I sprung for the Kobe burger, with spinach, Bleu cheese, peppered bacon, and a red wine and shallot sauce. Burger was cooked perfectly and tasted succulent, juicy, and buttery. Loved it!  Also had the  fat fries with dipping sauces. They were very good as well. Can't wait to return when in Vegas next.
1461	0	I've stayed at Caesar's Palace several times and always order to go from Noodle No.9. When ordering to go, the service is always professional, the food excellent. This time i decided to dine-in. My only explanation for the lack of good service would be that it must be a cultural one. The staff is pretty professional - but i never saw one smile. And when i would ask for a substitution, it was met with much resistance. Then, when ordering desert, i was in a hurry and wanted my ice cream to go, they said they wouldn't - i was like "put it in a dixie cup!" But i do have to say - the atmosphere is amazing and the food is great - i just think the entire staff needs to go through an american customer service training - ASAP!
777	1	LOVE this place.  Not only is it in my favorite Las Vegas hotel, The Cosmopolitan - but it exhudes that feeling of farmhouse crossed with Americanized swagger.  Walking in to a big cow at the front entry - you KNOW there is going to be some serious beef/meat here.  The menu is full of extremely inviting options.... right from the start.  You sit down to popcorn out of a tin, while choosing what to drink.  How a person can NOT have a milshake is beyond me.  And no, not for dessert.. but to start :)  Whether bam boozled or regular you cannot go wrong.  Remember all bam boozled shakes you can get without the liquor mostly, for 3 bucks less.  So.... even if you don't want the alcohol OR are still drunk from the daily festivities Vegas has to offer... you MUST get a shake.  Tiramisu, Vanilla, Drunken Monkey, Birthday Cake... grasshopper... all YUM!    Next is to decide on the main.  The salads are huge.  Everything is really.  The burgers are large and so so fresh.  Meat piled high on a fresh bun... with so many tasty toppings.  The steakhouse burger is amazing... although I could stand a few less black peppercorns.  The classic burger is even an smooth choice.  If you want a mountain of meat on a bun, they have that too.  OR if you are looking for something without beef... I guess that option is also available.  I don't think there would be a bad option - and I love finding out :)  The fries are okay... the sweet potato fries are better..  You can watch TV while in there... you'll get great service... and you surely won't be disappointed.  And truly the prices aren't THAT extreme considering you're in The Cosmo on the Strip in Las Vegas!
1892	0	This place is alright. I've been wanting to try it just because it's Serendipity and I haven't been to any of the other ones. I didn't have time to wait in line and eat there so my friends just went for the window instead.  My boyfriend and I shared a Cappuchino Frozen Hot Chocolate and one of the dogs. I think it was the regular one. New York Dog? Not sure.   The dog was just that. Just a hot dog. Nothing special.   I hardly noticed any cappuchino flavor in the frozen hot chocolate. I expected it to be more fabulous.  The only thing that really caught my eye here was the fact that they give you Total Rewards points for buying here. And that its plastic utensils are so shiny that they look like real silverware! lol
680	1	I grew up in Montana. I know a good burger when I sink my teeth into it. Imagine my surprise when the best burger I've ever had the opportunity to experience (at a restaurant,) came from Vegas.  The kobe beef burger is worth every penny. The service is great, Sin City beer is good. There can be a bit of a wait, depending on when you get there, but it's worth it.  Doesn't quite compare to the fresh burgers my dad used to make, but it comes damn close.  If you love burgers, you have to check out the Burger Bar.
1986	0	we came here for lunch in a large group and were utterly confused by the menu.  like everyone says, it's a restaurant w/ chinese and mexican food, not chinese-mexican fusion.  we started w/ pork buns, shuimai and veg dumplings, and they weren't really authentic.  i then got some cellophane noodle dish w/ 2 prawns in it.  it was pretty good, but at $18, it was kind of outrageous.  my friends who got tacos weren't even full, b/c they were so tiny, but they were like $6.50 each.  we ended up paying $40 a person for a very mediocre lunch.  definitely not worth it.
1838	1	It is not a secret anymore!!! So sad!! This place is open until 5am, and that is a beautiful thing! The pizza is reasonably priced considering that it's Las Vegas, and it's a NY size slice. It is PERFECT for a late night snack after Marquee.  Go find it! Good luck! There is no signage!
244	0	The food here is horrible.  Me and my hubby came here for lunch last Saturday before I went to go shoot a wedding over at the Flamingo (which is another damn story).  The price tag was off for the food they had to offer, but there wasn't a line around 1:45, it was almost $60 for the both of us.  They didn't even have any shell fish at this price.  I hadn't been to the MGM since I was a kid and wanted to just go and see it again and try the food, which proved to be horrific.  Going up and down the aisles, I realized that a lot of the food was really repetitive, they had your fried/southern comfort food, your "asian" food, including teriyaki fish, noodles, sushi, etc.  They had their breakfast items, salads, veggies, fruits, desserts.  I'm pregnant, which totally multiplies my love for food by like umpteenth times, but before being pregnant I could take down a whole cow if you gave me a few hours, but this place couldn't even make pancakes that were appetizing enough.  I had these scalloped potatoes with cheese and sour cream, I believe, on it, and the potatoes weren't even fully cooked.  Phil had some fried chicken and fish items, which were not good.  I also had the teriyaki fish I mentioned earlier and the minute I put it in my mouth I had this overwhelming taste of ginger.  I had the couscous salad which tasted much like toothpaste.  Honestly, I can say that the only thing good about this place was the veggies, oh and the nachos, but how could you fuck up tortilla chips and cheese, but everything else was horrible.  They put such a bad taste in my mouth that I didn't even bother getting desserts and I have the worst sweet tooth, and if anything I'm sure the desserts would've put me in a better mood.  In the end, we left unsatisfied, a trip to Carl's Jr. probably would've done a better job at feeding me and my husband.
898	0	If you are a tourist this is probably one of the best options on the stip to go and dance latin music. However, if you are a local I would not recommended.  This restaurant/bar has two floors: the first floor has the restaurant area where you can eat next to the dance floor. They play R&B, rap and a little bit of everything. The problem is that is next to the patio so I don't think they have AC, or if they do is extremely hot!! ( I promise you I'm not on my menopause yet and I was sweaty). on the second floor, they play Latin music, the dance floor  has a decent size, but I went on a Saturday night and there was hardly anyone there.. So if you have better option, I would totally go somewhere else.
1886	1	Food - AMAZING Service - superb Dcor - comfortable & inviting  The lobster macaroni and cheese may have been the best thing I've ever eaten in Vegas. It came with a mini lobster roll (not mentioned on the menu) and included a slice of bacon. When I told our server I wasn't expecting that and that I don't eat bacon, they brought me another mini sandwich sans bacon. While we're on the service, Porsha was awesome. She offered to split all our checks before and kept everyone's tabs in order. Smiled the whole time and was super friendly about recommendations.  The Frozen Grasshopper was like drinking the last of your Thrifty's mint chip ice cream. It was a tasty shake, but maybe not worth $11, $7 or $8 at best even with the Frangelico in there.   I also had the sliders, two tasty lil bundles of joy. The only knock on this place is on the homemade potato chips that came with them. I must have got some from hours ago because they were cold and rubbery. I bet a fresh & crispy batch would be very good there and would be great with any burger.  Next time I'm in Vegas, Holsteins is at the top of my dining list.
986	0	MGM Grand Hotel was one of my favorite Casino in Las Vegas.  Now I have to change my mind.  There Hotel service is way down and checking in takes way too long.  MGM I will keep my business with your family Casino line Aria and Etc.  But I don't think I will be stay in MGM Grand Hotel anymore.  Very disappointed!
1480	1	This place is always on my to do list when in Vegas whether it's for lunch, snack or late night eats.  Not  quite a secret but it is pretty hidden with no signage.  It's located on the 3rd floor in the Cosmopolitan Hotel.  You'll see a very long hallway with pictures on the wall and if it's late, you will usually see a line out the door.    They sell pizza by the slice for about $5.00+ and also whole pies.   They have more pizzas than what's on display so just order what you want and they can also throw some toppings on.  But my fav is the white pizza.   After you pick your pizza, you pay and then put your slice in the oven so it's hot and crispy when you get it.    If there's a line, I would wait, the pizza is worth it!!!
864	1	First let me say I am very critical of Breakfast spots. The staff here is great they are all in some form of Osh Kosh or Dickeys(one girl in Plus Four's, vest and pig tails). They were all shapes and sizes with ink and piercings. That alone made me happy! The wait was about 20min(If you have a large group be ready to wait a while, or be willing to break up into smaller partys) full bar makes the wait easy. The food is Huge, but tasty as hell. I wished there were more people at my table so there were more things to try. Oh well I'll be going back on a regular basis. I won't even get into the food I would just butcher the menu anyway. These guys have set the bar really high and have no competiton outside the casinos. If you are local try going on weekdays for shorter wait and less crowd. I wish there were more spots like this in Vegas! (!!!Don't be fooled into going to Hash House it is not the one!!!)
871	0	I ALMOST gave this place 3 stars, but the wait and service was so bad I can't make myself give anything higher than a 2. The 2 stars is based on the extra delicious frozen hot chocolate (that we had a coupon for, making it free), and the hot dog that ended up tasting pretty good.   Ok, so my husband and I got to Serendipity 3 at a decently off time. Didn't look too busy, so we put our names on the list and took a seat outside. We overheard someone say that if you sit at the bar you'll get served faster and you don't have to put your name on the list, so we tried that....didn't work. There are 4 or so chairs at the bar, so there went that idea. More waiting, waited so long that we had to eat a snack bar I had in my bag....before we ate lunch! I think our wait totaled about an hour for just the 2 of us. We were seated and it took our waiter 10 minutes before he came over to greet us and take our drink orders. Found out a few of the items that were on the menu were not supposed to be on there any longer (one of the items I was going to order, figures), so my husband ordered the grilled cheese with tomato soup and I ordered the mac & cheese. Simple enough. Our free frozen hot chocolate came out in this giant sundae glass,it was amazing! So good! We were expecting a tiny glass since it was free, but this could have fed a family of 4! Our food came out 35 or so minutes later, and my mac & cheese tasted like lighter fluid! It was so gross that even thinking about it right now makes me gag a bit. My husband's grilled cheese was gross too, same lighter fluid taste. Even his soup tasted like lighter fluid! I assumed it was the way they were cooking things so we brought this to the waiter's attention. He took my food back and came back to tell us that the cooks had no idea why it tasted like that and that no one else had complained. He offered to replace my gross food with something else, so I ordered a hot dog. Figured it would be safe since it wasn't covered in whatever gross cheese they were using.   We waited for my hot dog for 30 minutes!  A HOT DOG! I'm kind of hypoglycemic so by this point I was feeling pretty weak. I started spacing out, feeling nauseated, it was all I could to stay calm. My hot dog FINALLY came and I was at that point in my 'episode' where I was super nauseated, so I took a few bites and got a to-go box, which took another 10 minutes. It was just annoying how much time we spent waiting and the food wasn't even good. I ate my hot dog an hour or so later after I was feeling better and it was pretty good. If I ever went there again i'd go straight for that and a frozen hot chocolate, that's it. And i'd get it from the to-go window, not even bother going inside. My husband is curious about this giant donut we saw in the to-go window, so we might check that out next time. Not going out of our way though.
755	1	I took my girlfriend here for our one year anniversary last night. It was my first time there, but I had always heard great things about this place, so I figured I'd share this as another first with my girl and I'm glad I made that decision. There's a lounge where you can just sit and have a drink by the fire (the drinks were awesome!) And the cocktail waitresses were so nice. After a few drinks, we walked over to the dining room, which had a 50's retro feel. Our server Samantha was so nice. If you're looking for a nice place to go to for chorizo and eggs, pancakes, or any other feel-good food, come down to this place and enjoy!!
652	0	If you are coming to Vegas as a tourist...please please please do not go to Tao.  You are wasting your time and money.  The food is worse than PF Chang's and probably borderlines with Panda Express.  If you eat dinner in the restaurant they still make you leave the property and re-enter to go into the nightclub and pay full cover.  Once inside the club, it's just horrible music and bouncer telling you that you can't stand or walk anywhere.  It's disgustingly crowded and the staff treats you like crap.  So many better restaurants and nightclub on the strip to choose from.  This place is just living off their name...
53	0	I made the mistake of having such high expectations of China Poblano because they were just completely crushed.  I had heard so much about  culinary genius, Jose Andres and that is the reason I even went into the restaurant after perusing the menu.  If it was not associated with Jose Andres, I would have immediately done a 180 after seeing the $11.00 price tag on a serving a dim sum.    Jose Andres is known for his tapas servings and so our group ordered a number of tapas servings to share.  And they were just OK.  It wasn't bad, but it wasn't mind blowing either.  If I am paying $8 for a mini mini pork sandwich- it BETTER blow my mind, and it did not.  My favorite dish was the eggplant dish, but it wasn't fabulous enough for me to return. I even tried eating the Chinese dish and Mexican dish, side by side to see if that would make a difference in the "experience", but it didn't.  In fact, I still don't get it.  It was not a fusion restaurant, but rather two menus in one.   The ambience is cool and trendy, but next time I am considering Mexican or Chinese, I will definitely go elsewhere, where the flavor satisfaction matches the price.  I can get ambience elsewhere.
1717	1	OMG this was some of the best pizza I've ever had.  Went here with the mister around 8pm on a Sunday. No long line.  Awesome! We both got the ricotta and garlic and I got an additional slice of the green bell with sausage. I love that the crust was thin but with good flavor and that they serve you your drinks in red plastic cups hahha. Very comfy.  Yeah, there are no little signs to tell you what's what, but the guys there DO speak fluent English so you can just ask! Duhhhh. And if you have such a big problem with talking to people and asking questions, you can just point at whatever catches your eye. There ARE some combos that they don't have on the counter that are on shelves underneath.  You're guaranteed a fresh slice because that stuff is just going constantly.  I love that the place is not marked/listed on any directory and that you have to travel down a long hallway off the main part of the floor to find it.  Makes it feel kinda special.  Definitely coming back to try some of their other pizzas the next time I'm in Las Vegas!
206	0	I went here with 9 other people for Memorial Day weekend.  I've been to the NY one which I absolutely loved and was really excited to know that there's a Serendipity much closer to me now.  First thing I noticed was that they have a window by the side of the building from which you can order to go.  I found it really interesting and convenient that they did that.  Although there were long lines, they seemed to be moving rather quickly.  I have to say though, I was really disappointed by my experience with the Vegas Serendipity.  Their service sucks.  When I went to get a table, they told me the wait would be about an hour.  That's understandable and fine.  After 50 minutes of waiting, my friend suggested that we check to see how far along we were.  We go up to the bitchy hostess and she informed us that they had called us.  But our beeper never rang!  And we were waiting right outside their door the whole time.  Another server then explained to us that some of their beepers were broken and said that they'd clear a table for us immediately.  Which was nice except the extra little comment she had to add which was "You guys are lucky we'll clear a table for you now".  My friend and I just looked at each other astonished.  WTF?!  The beeper issue is not our problem, it's the restaurant's.  They shouldn't be so cheap and use beepers that are broken.  Still, we didn't let that damper our mood.  We went on our merry ways and ordered a load of food.  (Their menu, compared to the NY branch, is not as long and may differ a bit)  I shared an omelette with a friend and ordered the Forbidden Broadway Sundae for myself.    The omelette was plain but decent.  Nothing worth talking about.  The sweet potatoe fries that came with it were really good but not so much after you take it home as leftovers.  When our waiter was taking down our orders, he had made it a point to ask me whether I had wanted my dessert after or with my entree to which I replied after since I didn't want to the ice cream to melt.  For some reason, my dessert was brought out with my entree.  When I told the guy that brought it out, he proceeded to give me attitude and told me "Well it's already here.  If I were to bring it back, it'll take another 20 minutes.  But I mean... I could bring it back if you really want."  I told him it was ok and he just rushed off.  No apology, no empathy, nothing.  Whatever.  I had a great dessert piled with whip cream that I had asked to be left out.  Oh well.  What could I have done at that point?  Overall, it wasn't worth it.  The food for the most part is mediocre (my friend told me the One-Eyed Jack was bad and that the bread was so hard it was inedible) and the prices are high.  If you want to go just to say you went, then go.  Otherwise, avoid it.  There are a bunch of great buffets (Wynn!) you can hit up in Vegas.
886	1	Never in my life did I expect to succumb to the chicken and waffles craze. But my friend invited me here for brunch and after reading the reviews I had to consider it.  And then I ordered it. And oh my was it delicious. Moan with happiness every five minutes delicious. I pretty much had a near religious experience with this dish. The roasted chicken + brown Thanksgiving-style gravy paired with the bacon and chive waffle + vanilla bean butter + maple syrup all sounds like an odd couple, but was absolutely and positively magical. The flavors mixed together so amazingly that I was in shock. Every now and then I'd eat only the chicken or waffle, but would quickly return to the well engineered combo. That's right, engineered - it was clear that this dish was well thought out.  Now that I've gushed about the chicken and waffles to the point of boring you, I must also note that the complimentary bread and butter were also divine. And the house coffee is some of the best coffee I've ever had. Truly an amazing experience all around, and one that I will be dreaming of frequently.
1454	0	Touted as the best buffet in Las Vegas.   It is far, far from that!  The cashier could not have been any ruder or nasty.  She barked where we had to stand after paying for the buffet to be seated.  The food we mediocre at best.  The array of food was intriguing but the majority of the stations felt as if the food was there for a long time.  The fried rice and sliders had no taste.  Service was slow and agonizing while we waited to be served our drinks.  It felt to us as if the wait staff was severely understaffed.  There are much better buffet in Las Vegas and I highly recommend that you skip this one .  The Buffet at Ceasar's is outstanding .
414	0	Old, old, old, and too far down the strip.  I stayed here to go on the cheap.  Not next time.  They really ticked me off the last day.  First, they tacked on an energy surcharge when I checked out.  Is this something required by law of all the hotels now?  This did not happen before.  If it is not law, it is crap!  They should have just added it into the price of their crappy rooms!  To top it off, we went the night before to print out our boarding passes.  they guy at the desk said he couldn't help us, even though he was just chatting up his co-worker.  He told me I could either use my credit card for the machine in the lobby or to go to the business center in the morning.  Assuming it was free (remember, my friends, what it means to assume!) we walked allllllllll the way across the hotel to be informed that there was a dollar a minute charge to use the internet and a 50 cent fee for each sheet of paper we printed off, even though we were guests of the hotel.  What if their internet was as slow as their hotel is old?  It would have cost us a lot for a dollar a minute!  What a load of crap!  I realized then how far away I was from the Bellagio...  One star because they are next to the Peppermill, one of the best places for breakfast in Vegas!!!
1591	0	The Food here is not any better than the other Buffets in Vegas. But they run a ridiculous system here. They close down the buffet between meals.   On the day of my visit, We where outside lining up to get in. I saw no signs that they close between meals. No staff to attend to customers. Only an enclosure placed in front of the escalator.  We where the first few people in front of the line for we arrived 9 45 am. By 10:30 a cashier came up taking customers. So we paid for the meal hoping we going to have lunch soon.  To my surprice another line was being formed downstairs. No one was seating the customers. So we had to wait another 30 min to get to our tables.   This is truly stupid coz lunch is more expensive than breakfast. There is no point of making people wait if they have paid for lunch during breakfast hour.  I asked the server why such a system. She told me that employees takes there break during these times. In other words, the buffet is understaff.  I tell you the food is no better than any great Vegas buffet. Go somewhere else. Its not worth the wait.
549	1	This spot is GREAT from top to bottom and man on man they do some business there. From the Shakes to the Buns to the massive beer list and Adult Vitamins and the wonderful, addictive and creative desserts... it's on! I love it and all of my friends love it. I've been several times and each time we all have fun, which is worth any price... and these prices are more than worth it. Love It!
1438	1	My husband and I came here on our last day in Las Vegas, and had been waiting since we planned our wedding and seen them featured on Triple D. We ordered the Oxtail Fries which are absolute heaven. Only need to caution they come loaded with jalapenos, and my husband isn't extremely fond of them ( i love them) and accidentally ingested a few pieces since they were covered by the delicious melty cheese gooeyness and chili cheese oxtail mixture. Not greasy, well balanced appetizer, wish there was one here in FL!. We ordered a burger each, he ordered the Kikki and I got the Miyagi. Both medium, served pink in the center, but not raw or bleeding, perfectly cooked. Meat still had the grilled taste, wasn't over seasoned, over all the burgers were well made. Definately favorite part was the fries, I was sad I didn't have room to try those yummy milkshakes listed, maybe next time!
1347	1	We had reservations at 5pm on a Friday. We wanted reservations at 6pm but couldn't get in. We were concerned it was too early but really had no choice. It turned out prefect because our server asked about our plans for the evening & we told him we had a show to catch at 9 so he planned the timing of our courses. They took their time & brought everything out at a prefect time! Loved it! That was so thoughtful of them!  I have to say we had the best time, meal & service at Gordan Ramsay Steak during our short stay in Vegas! The atmosphere was nice & dim even though it was a little loud in there. We had oysters on the half shell, foie gras, ribeye, lamb, truffle fingerling potatoes, asparagus, bone morrow & the sticky toffee pudding.   Oysters were prefect! There were 3 different kinds of oysters & it came with 3 different sauces to top off. The foie gras was amazing! It was our first time having foie gras. I've seen what it looked like but wasn't sure how the taste & texture was. We loved it & will definitely have it more often! The foie gras had a nice sear on the outside & it came with 2 small pop overs that had gooseberries & gooseberry sauce. It was delicious! Everything paired so nicely! The ribeye was cooked to perfection! There was a nice char on the outside from the grill & the inside was nice & medium rare, how we ordered it. It didn't come with sides so we ordered the truffle fingerling potatoes - it was just ok to me & the asparagus -this was delish! Cooked perfectly! The lamb came with 1 lamb chop, a small Shepards pie, roasted carrots & mashed potatoes. Loved everything except the pie was too salty for me. The bone morrow was just ok. I've had better. I didn't care for that green sauce on top. Not even sure what it was. The dessert, sticky toffee pudding was to die for!!!!!! It was like a small cake & they poured toffee sauce on top & it came with brown butter ice cream shaped like a stick of butter. Heaven!! Soooooo good! The coffee came in a french press & they even provided 3 complimentary chocolate spoons (had alky in it) to stir into your coffee. I passed on that since I'm pregnant but hubby tried it. Be careful, he said it was pretty sweet so you might not want to use all the chocolate.  Very pricy but definitely a must try, at least once.
1820	0	Standard buffet. I'm glad we had coupons for $5 off from our IP fun book because there's no way I'd want to pay full price here. We were fairly hungry when we went here so I assumed we'd go to town on everything, but it wasn't anything worth going back for seconds. There was a nice variety of foods, from Mexican and Asian to Amerian and a salad bar (with the bucket of shrimp on ice...literally, there was ice in with the shrimp that I didn't know about until I looked at my plate and had to "fish" [haha] for my shrimp around the ice cubes.) The food wasn't horrible, but I expected more from a name like 'Harrah's.'
1176	1	Awesome place. Looks really cool, plates, silverware good presentation was all very unique and cool.  The food wasn't huge portion, but the taste is incredible. Fries, dessert and burgers were all so good. When we go back to Vegas, we are coming back!  Decent prices too!!
226	0	Went here last weekend for my honeymoon. What a disaster of a buffet! $30 dollars for food that tasted like it had been prepped a week in advance and over nuked in a microwave. This is the WORST buffet I have ever ate at. DON'T WASTE YOUR MONEY when you go to Vegas. Can't say it enough...bad...Bad..BAD!!!
1722	0	I seriously don't understand the hype.  I went on an adventure to just to get here, and I was fairly disappointed. The line wrapped around and almost reached the dining tables. The wait just to order took about 30 minutes, and the wait for the food was about an additional 20.  I ordered a bunch of cheese sliders and original sliders to bring back to the hotel for my group of friends. Needless to say, my first White Castle slider will probably be my last White Castle slider. There was nothing special about it, and I definitely was not impressed. The patty was incredibly thin and I don't remember it tasting much like anything.  I will consider trying the one on the east coast, but I will not be returning to this location.
1483	1	This is how it should be done.  I have eaten at several Thomas Keller establishments around the country, and while in Vegas for a convention, I decided to escape the endless corporate buffets I had been subsiding on all week and seek out something a little more satiating.  I managed to con one of my co-workers into coming with me; she was very pregnant at the time.  I was a little bit concerned as it has been my experience in many Las Vegas 'clone' haute cuisine restaurants that the price is certainly high, the food is passable, and the service can be abysmal.  The restaurant is in the Venetian, and is a beautiful recreation of a French Bistro.  Black and white tile floors and nice display cases show off the pastries and the fruits de mer.  We were seated immediately and were engaged by the server in very short order.  He was fantastic, I wish I could remember his name, but he was truly passionate about the food and very knowledgeable.  He was very quick to supply my colleague with some fresh bread of her choosing to satisfy her needs.  He also was well-versed in wines and was able to explain menu items to my dining companion, who was a fine-dining novice, in terms that did not intimidate or patronize her.  My first course was the charcuterie plate, which was fantastic.  A very healthy portion of a number of fresh, house-made sausages and confit with some amazing pickles and spreads.  They were also generous with the mini-baguettes, I hate it when charcuterie plates are stingy with bread.  For the second course, I went with the waiter's recommendation of a platter of a half-dozen or so oysters, again, very great suggestions and very fresh.  For my main course, I had the short ribs, which evaporated into rich, meaty love in my mouth.  The waiter paired up a fantastic red to go along with it, played off the marrow perfectly.  One of the best servings of short ribs I've ever had, including my own, which I can make pretty damn well.  For dessert, we had a selection of pastries, among them profiteroles, which were perfect with the very fresh dark coffee they served me with it.  The waiter was kind enough to call an ambulance which whisked me away after I entered a post-dinner food coma.  A fantastic meal, with fantastic service - I don't hand out fives frequently, but am proud to give this establishment that honor.
396	1	When in Vegas....  There are so many places to get a good burger, but a great burger AND a shake?! Yeah, Holsteins Shakes & Buns at the Cosmopolitan is the spot. Located on the second floor right off the escalators, look for the cutest cows. The decor at Holsteins is really eye-catching and cute. According to one of the servers, they just changed the artwork last week. (Check some out, I took photos.) There's a bar in the front and the restaurant is located towards the back.   Right after you are seated, you are treated to delish popcorn with cajun seasoning. Seriously, nom nom nom....I could've eaten it all and then some. But, I knew I had to save room for my shake and burger. Hubby and I decided to share a shake and a burger since we didn't want to be stuck with leftovers. That was a good choice because for $9, you get a quality size shake and the extras (that don't fit in the cup). We ordered a vanilla shake that just might have been the most delish shake I've ever had. It was topped with a lot of whipped cream and these tiny pearl balls that were so yummy. We decided on the FUN-ghi burger ($17) which is a beef patty topped with forest mushrooms, caramelized onions, gruyere cheese, frisee, and truffle mayo. Every burger comes with fries and they were yummy! The burger was juicy, messy, and flavorful - but not sure it was worth the $17. (I figured it was hotel food so, hence, the jacked up price.)  Overall, service, atmosphere, and the food were awesome. I would give this place 4 and a half stars, but rounded it up for Yelp purposes. (Gotta take into consideration that it's a food place in a fancy hotel and on the Strip, so you know you are gonna have to pay a premium for food.) In any case, if you've already checked out Wicked Spoon and Secret Pizza at the Cosmo, Holsteins is your next best choice. More popcorn, please!
1182	0	I have very mixed feelings about this hotel.  I booked an air+hotel deal through vegas.com which came out to under $500 for roundtrip flights from NYC and four nights at LVH, which sounded like a great deal at the time.  However, I recommend you shell out the extra money to get a hotel ON the actual strip, not "just off the strip."    The bad: First, other than the gas station across the street and convention center next door, there is absolutely NOTHING surrounding this place except shady and cheap hotels.  The walk to Encore alone is about a mile, which although doesn't seem like much, sucks because of the Las Vegas heat AND the fact that from there you still have to walk so much to get to where the life is- Venetian, Caesars, Cosmopolitan, etc.  Cabs are so expensive and the group I was with would end up caving and shelling out cab fare every night to get to and from restaurants/shops/clubs and they are not cheap!  The hotel is definitely dated and could use a bit of a facelift, but it isn't terrible.  The food in the hotel is obscenely expensive.  They had a Keurig coffee machine in the room, but it was $4 PER SMALL MEASLY CUP OF COFFEE.  Insane.  I ended up going to the cafe downstairs (called Fortuna) and paying $4.27 for a large coffee.  More bang for my buck I guess.  I'd recommend going across the street to the gas station for coffee, but I got lazy and didn't want to start sweating first thing in the morning.  The hotel also offers a go-green option where you opt out of having your room cleaned in exchange for your choice of either an $8 dining credit or $10 casino credit.  Out of the two days we did that, we got the voucher only once and when I called to complain they would not honor it saying my room "wasn't in the system" for going green, which was complete BS.  The good: The rooms were clean and a decent size.  We ate at the Benihana the first night which was good, it was a very big restaurant and the service was good.  There were always cabs outside so it was easy to get one.  There is a monorail station at the hotel too, which we did not use but what's the point when it doesn't service the strip?  We did not use the hotel pool until the last day and to my surprise it wasn't too bad.  The pool was a nice size and the bar had a 2-for-1 happy hour with good drinks and a DJ.
719	0	Honesty, I would want to give this place 1 star...but the Excalibur buffet is worse...which automatically bumps this place up to two stars....but let me tell you....it a VERY low 2 stars. NOTHING was exciting about this buffet. I do feel like I need to provide at least one positive thing, however the only positive thing I can think of is the seating arrangement. The seating is arranged so that it is not so "Cafeteria style". IDK if thats so much of a positive but that is the best I could do.   The food is bland, not seasoned well. Plain boring "Comforter food". Waaaaaaaay over priced for the food they provide. I paid $38 for the all you can eat day pass, but will NEVER do that again. It is NOT a deal if you don't like the food and don't eat it. I tried a little bit of everything (My buffet ritual) But I literally took one bite and put it down and moved to the next. I honestly don't remember taking more than one bite of anything. It was gross.  I went to McDonald's an hour later and had the best meal I had that day. And I don't even eat McDonald's. Ok so perhaps I'm being a little harsh....but to be honest, you can pay that same exact price to eat at the Wicked Spoon (BEST BUFFET ON THE STRIP, Don't believe yelp it)  anyways like I was saying, you can pay the same price, and eat like a Queen or King until you are stuffed!! And you still will want to eat because EVERYTHING is so tasty, you'll be so stuffed you won't need to eat for the rest of the day. ( At least that is what happened to me on several occasions) There fore, you are pretty much paying the same price for the days worth of food, but with a better experience. \  But bottom line, even if I were to get a free pass for this buffet, I would probably try to sell it to a foolish person for $5, take that and go put it in a slot machine. I wouldn't eat this food again if it were free, now, if I were starving...maybe...but then again,  it's Vegas...no such thing as starving....so nope...won't be eating here again EVER.    BLAH
68	1	04/10/2014:  This place is a must for Thai food lovers visiting Vegas. It is a bit off the strip, but, worth the drive. And you'll likely have to wait a while unless you were lucky to get through ahead of time to make a reservation. The cab drivers will also vouch for the popularity and demand of this place.   We had the usual Pad Thai and Papaya Salad for appetizers. The grilled shrimp, green, red, and yellow curries are all good. The squid salad is excellent. The basil and garlic eggplant dish is excellent. You can substitute green beans if you're not a fan of eggplant. If you like your food spicy and your guests do not, make sure to ask for the fish sauce and fresh Thai bird chillies. That gives it a nice kick. Just be careful, it can make a grown man cry. One if our guests tried some and had tears run down his face as he grabbed for the Chang beer.   Chang beer is the best pairing for Thai food - IMHO. They have a huge wine cellar and it sure looks impressive behind the glass room. However, I just can't seem to muster up the taste buds to pair this amazing Thai food with wine.   I have been to this restaurant several times before. Finally making the time to recognize this place for the fine food it produces. I've turned a few business clients on to this place. They are hooked too. Always a must for me when in Vegas. Some reviewers describe this place as the best Thai food in the US, it's hard to argue with them.
1307	0	I usually give companys a break but i truly think this company needs great improvement,  the service as far as how long it took to get a burger was very poor it took 25 to 35 minutes  after the initial 15 minutes it took just to get our server to the table to receive our food the food was ok but not really very good, my friends said they had Mexican food and it was definitely better it hot on the patio no misters .
1322	1	Oh my god! Best breakfast/brunch I've had in my life! Everything was traditional american breakfast fare with a twist. The presentation of the food is quite amazing, and the taste is just as much. Bring an appetite to this place, because the portions are no joke, and chances are you'll be able to share.
230	0	Once was enough for me. I am not coming back.  Not only is the service terrible, but the food is vastly overpriced, even for the strip. I waited about 40 minutes for ONE very simple, yet expensive dessert. I expected the quality to at least be great, but it was sightly above average at best. Nobody in my group was impressed.  In addition, a few of my friends recently received melted ice cream from this place. For a restaurant that is known for its desserts, that is unacceptable. Never mind, that should be unacceptable everywhere!  Satisfy your sweet tooth somewhere else.
1085	0	Nasty!!!  Our first experience here was when they first opened...its was good! Food was good, customer service was good. This time its completely different. Burns gross fries, horrible nasty "customer" service, sent the fries back to only get back-talk from one of the employees!! Who does that!!! I'm guessing poor management is to blame? I'm not sure. The only thing good was the sliders!
1043	0	I stayed in the Mediterranean Tower on a Thursday until Sunday at The Riveria. There wasn't a refrigerator in our room, the room didn't come stocked with all of the essentials for travel, the TV service in the room is lacking (HDTV with no HD and lousy low def lodgenet service), and we had two rooms we had booked to be next to each other, but they were not able to make this happen. However, the casino is very nice and the staff is very friendly, and there's a nice pool and a tattoo shop along with other shops. Just take note that the Mediterranean Tower is inexpensive, so expect to be a bit underwhelmed. The one thing that made my 3 star rating a 2 star was the unavailability of WiFi, which is crucial for someone like me. The WiFi was working great on our first night's visit, but then the WiFi network dropped off early the next day on my and my friend's devices, and I was unable to log on with my laptop computer. Certainly the hotel can provide better coverage, especially for someone who might have to remotely connect into work in the case of an urgent matter, and it would have also been nice to play music on too. Of course I was in an inexpensive part of the hotel, but I wouldn't stay at a hotel that didn't have reliable WiFi. I called the front desk to complain and they thanked me for reporting it, but unfortunately we were unable to get back on the WiFi network in my and my friend's room, and we were a good distance apart. I hate to say it, but I don't think I would stay at this hotel unless I was given a free night's stay in a better room with WiFi that will continue to work. Here's hoping they give me a chance to formulate a second opinion. ;-)
1772	0	The hotess greated us and sat us took a while for the waitress to come take our order she was to busy talking with the staff. Once she took our order we watched her again took about 5 minutes for her to enter the order into the computer another 5 for our drinks and then our order was screwed up. The waitress never checked on us and gave us the bill with the item we did not get. When we told her she seemed shocked and had the manager take it off. Service is horrible would never go back even for a free meal better burger places in vegas then this
860	1	Super friendly staff, ambiance is warm and hip. Chicken Karage was perfect, ordered marinated spare ribs, pork belly, beef toro and bulgogi. All was amazing!! They play music videos on a big screen on the wall and it's just the right volume and a great choice of music.   Happy hour is 3pm-6pm and 10pm- close. Ordered broccoli, asparagus, and sweet corn. Perfect amount for 4 people.   Would definitely eat here again when we come back to visit from the Bay!!
402	1	Absolutely delicious! And the portions are big enough for 2 people! My fianc and I visited the Peppermill on our trip to Las Vegas via a recommendation from one of my good friends. It was not on the strip, so I was a little unsure about heading there at first, but it is more than worth it. We were there for breakfast and the omelets were huge! The menu is pretty extensive, mostly basic dinner food, but something for everyone. I am a lover of breakfast to begin with, but I was over the moon about this place. Did I mention their sugar is colored? At first glance, it almost looks like glitter! LOVE! The service was quick and everyone was friendly. The waitresses wear uniforms that go along with the ambiance of the place: Vegas meets townie dinner meets flamingos...very neat little place that I would have never found if it weren't for a friend who visits her family. I will definitely be returning for another breakfast or two on our next trip to Vegas! Go and get an omelet, you won't be disappointed!
147	1	Every time I come to Vegas this place is a must. The servers are very sweet (shout out to Jessica, our amazing server, who told us to go for the waffle with strawberries and cream - it was amazing and fluffy and warm and oh man. Miss it already. Sigh) and their little egg notification for need something/satisfied) is adorable. Go. You won't regret it.  Get the skillet. Their potatoes are SO GOOD.   Check in for their free banana nut muffin. It's also SO GOOD.   What are you waiting for? Go!!!
531	1	Meeting chef Scott!!!  Ordered the fish and chips.  The fish was the best I have ever had. The chips were not good.  The manager came and asked for feedback. He said they have been trying to perfect the chips and are still working on it. He was awesome, he send over 2 Carmel toffee desserts at no charge that were amazing!  The server was Alise and she was awesome!!  She event sent out chef Scott, as we really wanted to meet him.  I tasted my friends shepherds pie and it was very good.  The bangers and mash were good also.  I liked the branding and atmosphere.  Definitely will be a happy memory or this vacation.
171	1	Went here for lunch on New Year's Day and it was amazing! The guys who work at the counter were so friendly and provided exceptional service! For our friend he was given a small slice (which really wasn't that small), but the guy at the counter threw in a free extra slice without us even a asking! Wow! Not only that, but the guy also made sure to give me a perfect slice! Seriously, the pizza was delicious, but what really won us over was how friendly and awesome the crew are! They also found out it was my boyfriends birthday and they made sure to all wish him well and gave him a yummy dessert on the house! We will definitely be sure to make secret pizza a vegas tradition from now on!! Wonderful experience!!!
1635	0	This place is poorly run.  The people at register have two lines, one for platinum and one for regular customers. Both were empty so we thought it'd be fine to just ealk in through the platinum entrance because we didn't want to walk around the corner and have to follow some velvet rails, but apparently it isn't ok and we were told to go out and line up again anyways, a waste of everyone's time. Then they have a line for a waitress. What kind of buffet has seating waitresses? I've never had to be shown to a designated seat at any type of AYCA and this place isn't even busy. There's seating EVERYWHERE. Lastly for ll that, utensils are managed by the waiters. I couldn't get a new fork for this second dish that had vastly different food. I dont want my meat forks in my salads because it's greasy.  Foodwise, it's definitely not as good as it looks. Rhe selection is also really small for the price we payed, but it's Vegas so I expected as much. At least it looks nice here.
1994	0	Why oh why didn't I check the yelp reviews first?  Oh that's right, because I didn't dare risk using anything wireless during hacker conferences.  I hope you don't either.  But I digress.  Definitely watch the flashy handmade noodle show, both stretched and sliced off of a big brick of dough.  They looked appealing but tasted super bland, no matter what sauce or soup they put it in (we tried the beijing pork and black bean sauce specialty and the wonton noodle soup.)  I also got the taro boba (tapioca drink) and it had huge chunks of ice and was more vanilla tasting than taro.  I'm not hating on this place because it's "Americanized," I couldn't care less if it's not what people in Beijing eat.  All I care about is it TASTING GOOD.  Bleh.
519	1	GREAT LOCAL FIND! Good place to eat. I love their drink selections, and their food. I'm a big fan of kimchee and beef so my favorite burger has to be the Kalbi burger. I also like the Ronin burger. I mean who doesn't love fried egg and katsu in their burger. Right? Their fries are awesome! I recomment the garlic parmesan fries are awesome. LOADED with flavor. Very garlicy and lost of parmesan in it if you like that. If you want to go for a softer tasting flavor for fries I'd say the sweet potatoes. Those go really well with the Kalbi burger. I also might suggest that you try at least ONE drink that isn't a coke or pepsi product. Their beverages are one of a kind, and tastey. So be brave! Try one of them. The feel of the place is very simple, hip, and urban. Easy enough. It doesn't have all the extra mumbo jumbo or glitz and glamour of the strip. So if you are looking for a casual place to eat with great service. Try it! I swear it is an experience!
504	1	Found this gem on Yelp! Went here on a Wednesday about 6 P.M. The wait was not too bad. About 15 minutes. We were sat and then the magic began. We ordered the Meat Lovers meal and let me tell you, it was delicious. The food came out very fast. We were grilling in no time! What a fun experience! Definitely would have costed double on the strip.   *Tip: make a review and get a free dessert! What what!??
189	0	- - FOOD POISON - - BAD SERVICE - - AWFUL MANAGEMENT - -  We stayed at Mandalay Bay for our Vegas trip and decided to get something to eat late night, unfortunately the only place open was Citizens Kitchen. We walked in and got seated, the server had problems taking our orders and since he thought he could remember everything without writing it down he then brought out some of the food wrong. It took them 30-35minutes to bring out the food. No one wants to wait that long for food at 2am. Five out of  six people ordered the same food and it was the Burger and let me tell you that the vacation ended right there! Every single person had the worst stomach pain and you can imagine the rest!  I asked for a refund  the following day,  the managers told me that I should send an email with my experience so they could look it over, Nick one of the managers actually tried to help and he told us that they were very embarrassed over this and would do anything to fix it so he asked for the receipt and that he would refund the money, until today I only received $45 out of almost $180, they couldn't even track our bill and refund the rest being that they have an advanced POS system. It took them 3 weeks to refund the $45 while I had to text and call everyday.  Two of the five  people that had food poisoning  actually went to the doctors the day after and were told that it was 100% food poisoning.  Save yourself some time  and pain, do not  go to this place. It has awful food and service. I will never go back to this place and will never ever recommended this place to anyone!  - - - FOOD POISONING IN VEGAS ON YOUR 1st DAY OF VACATION, HOW MUCH FUN IS THAT - - -    Manadalay Bay should seriously think about renting to this place since they are inside of this hotel and getting so many bad reviews...........
326	1	Eating here was the gastronomic highlight of our family Vegas trip, and Bouchon did not disappoint.    The opening bread was warm, soft, and crunchy and the butter was sweet.  For starters, we had the special pork belly and the salmon rillette.  The pork belly melted in your mouth.  The rillette was served in a jar; the waiter scooped out the clarified butter off the top that sealed in the flavor of the salmon.  It was served with some toasted bread and went well with the tableside pot of mustard that is typical of a classic French bistro.  For entrees, we enjoyed the Beef Bourguignon and the Leg of Lamb.  The Bourguignon smelled and tasted great and was fork tender.  The Leg of Lamb was sliced thin and delivered a perfect medium rare and had a delicious au jus.  For dessert, we enjoyed the three Bouchon brownies with ice cream.    Service and atmosphere were excellent.  The room had mirrors and tiled floors to remind you of Paris.  We came with our 2 daughters (ages 7 and 10) and they enjoyed the Macaroni au Gratin (mild cheese and good for the young pallet) and the Croque Madame, which had a fried egg on top of buttery toasted bread that sandwiched in tasty ham and cheese.  Overall, a great experience.  I love bistro food and always seek it out whenever I travel.  This is as close as I'll get to Thomas Keller's French Laundry or Per Se for a few years, and it lived up to my expectations.
941	1	Modern Korean bbq with a great selection of meats and appetizers. It's a mix between Korean and Japanese and the quality of the meat is much better than all you can eat. I recommend both the marinated and non marinated Kalbi for beef. Spicy garlic and calamari and spicy pork are also great. Close to the strip is well and much better than anything close by.
37	1	We have long anticipated having dinner here and with all the hype over Gordon's celebrity and the Hell's Kitchen competition, it did not let us down. The service was exceptional: from giving us an ipad with the drink menu on it allowing us to email ourselves information on the wine we drank; to cleaning the table of crumbs and replacing the cutlery between each course; to placing our plates of food on the table simultaneously with 2 servers. The food was fantastic. Melt in your mouth, and even though we were stuffed we had to have the toffee pudding which was to die for! We will visit again on our next trip to Vegas!
709	0	It's a 2...because we didn't spit it out LOL. That's a good start, right? Makes your mouth water? It also gets a 2 instead of a 1 because it was very organized. The line looked really long, but we were only in line for about 10-15 minutes and then it took maybe another 5 to get the actual food.  So here's the deal. My husband and I have lived in So-Cal all our lives, so even though we've always heard of White Castle---the East Coast version of In n Out, we had never gotten to try it. We were SUPER excited when we randomly saw they had one in Vegas that we had to stop and try it! Yay!  We had seen the frozen ones at Ralphs for years, but didn't ever want to ruin our first experience for when we did eventually get to try the real thing....in hindsight I feel like the frozen ones might actually be better!  We weren't very hungry so we just ordered 2 cheese sliders and 1 double cheese slider with no onions for me. PROTIP: Yes you can order individually even though they aren't on the menu that way.  We were lucky enough to instantly find a table (it was packed), sat down, and dug in. Upon first bite we both looked at each other with a WTF look on our faces. We had waited years to try this? Avoided the frozen version? Waited in line. Ew.  The buns were soggy and wet, the meat was gray. Not a good combination. Like I said we didn't spit them out, so I guess it gets a 2 star, but OMG they were pretty close to terrible.   This is what all the hype is about? I admit I think they're cute in those little boxes, but the compliments pretty much end there.   I think I figured it out though...you must have to be high riding on white tigers like Harold and Kumar to be able to say you enjoyed those things.  Thanks but no thanks White Castle...ew.  In N Out for the win....West Coast 4eva!
31	1	This dining experience did not disappoint!  From the amazing bread, to the famous Beef Wellington for 2!  The service is impeccable, food outstanding, and the atmosphere was beautiful.  The Wellington was tender enough to cut with a fork, and that is not an exaggeration!  We will be back, 5 stars+++, just go and enjoy the experience, you cant get it many places!
793	1	Great food. Great prices (for the strip). Line was long, but moved fast. We had to wait for a seat, but eventually we got one before food was available for pickup. We went around 8:30 pm on Sunday night (Labor Day weekend). Wife and I shared Shack Stack burger and cheese fries. We had complementary water. Burger was really great. Portobello was loaded with cheese and popped when cut in half. Meat was cooked just right. Wife did not like cheese on her fries; I did. I am happy that Shack Shack is coming to Downtown Summerlin.
907	1	We ALWAYS take our visiting friends here, without fail. Asian fusion burgers never tasted better. I love their taro bun burger as well as the banh mi burger. My husband's go-to order is kiki's burger. Since we've started going there about a year ago, they've added a multitude of appetizers and desserts, probably due to the hours extension and additional bar. For the exotic beers they offer, I can see the draw in that. My family and I, however, have only eaten their for lunch or dinner.   We've never had bad service. Beware of wait times, though!
1459	1	We had dinner here on Christmas Day. It was very busy but yet the service was superb. There were 4 of us so I was expecting that the service will be a little sluggish given the holidays. So, that said, It's pretty safe to say that you can come this place anytime of the year and still get the best service. If you do visit, try their Specialties. I guarantee you, you will leave this restaurant happy and satisfied. Oh, and save room for desserts!
434	0	There was a little bit of line.  Came here for frozen hot chocolate for $14.00, for small glass. Too sweet and overprice!  Didn't really like the looks of then food from other people's table.  Portion was huge and nothing really stands out.  I guess people who likes quantity than quality love to go there.  I think this place is overrated.  Thanks!
1498	0	I guess this is the place drunk people go to eat after a night of hard partying when they don't really care if the food tastes delicious or not. I've given this place a few tries, but each time I've been disappointed. The meat in the banh mi is almost nonexistent and has a rubbery texture, like it's been sitting out all day. The bread is stiff and hard all throughout when a well-baked baguette should be soft on the inside. Service isn't all that different from a fast food restaurant, you get in line and pay for your order, then they call out your number. I haven't tried their American style breakfast sandwiches, but if they can't even make their Vietnamese sandwiches right, I'm scared to taste their American sandwiches. I'd rather take my money to Hue Thai or Dakao.
73	0	Was excited to come to the Riv again since they announced t was being demolished.  Had such great memories here as a kid.  But WOW was it BAD!!  The only thing that was god was the parking.  Both myself and my daughter got ill after eating breakfast in the caf.  For 3 breakfast items it was over $50 with a tip and it was HORRIBLE!!!  Very sad to see this historic landmark go but employees have already checked out.  Stay away and go somewhere else.
1315	0	If your waiter has a faux hawk and mutton chops, go ahead and kick that d-bag in the balls for me.   This was the worst service I have ever had in my life.  Took two hours to eat a quesadilla cause our ass whipe of a waiter couldn't be found.  When he was found, he would bring you the wrong drink, or poor water into your soda. All in all, I would give this place zero if I could.  I just hope that DoucheBag McMuttonChops didn't spend his $0.20 tip in one place.
217	0	Never again. We had two free vouchers so we went for lunch and I'm so glad that I didn't have to pay for this meal. They had seafood, Asian, Indian, Mediterranean, and different meats as well as a variety of desserts.  We tried a little of almost everything and our tastebuds were bored at best.    I would not come back to this buffet unless it was free again.
704	1	Love this place--it's like Cheers, everybody knows my name! Been eating here since I was in Elementary school....did you know this place opened up in 1983? Just a little food for thought! :)  Anyway, about the food...I love and highly suggest the: -Italian skillet -Corn beef hash And my new favorite... -Pork Carnitas!!!!!! (Drool)  Do yourself a favor and give this place a shot, it's an oldie but a goodie! :)
846	1	Best burger of my LIFE! I came for my birthday and we almost walked away when we saw the line. Turns out it moved fast and I was impressed with their technology. They send you a text when your table is ready so you can walk away and get a drink nearby and relax. After a short wait we were at our table. You could tell they thought about everything. The waitress was very informed about every item on the menu, even when the food was served they make sure to face every plate in the same exact position.   But let me get to the food. Prices extremely reasonable, especially considering this is a gourmet restaurant. All the choices were appetizing, I went with the Euro burger (truffle, goat cheese, arugula) and my boyfriend the boar. We had the truffle fries to share. Everything was as good as it gets. The meat was cooked just enough and juicy. Again I was so impressed at how well thought out everything was.   I cannot wait to return here!
569	1	I am a fan! I have heard about Bachi Burger forever and was happy to see it and when I drove by, made a U turn!  The way I judge a burger is by the flavor of the meat. I cannot eat gluten so I do not get to have the joy of a bun, so when a burger is seasoned well it is a pleasure for the palate. Bachi Burger does it oh so right that I did not miss the bun. I was in heaven. We both ordered the Kiki Burger, and I wish one would have tried a different one but I now have a reason to return! The meat,the carmelized onions, mushrooms and cheese was pure decadence. I give the server props for letting me know the sauce was not gluten free! That was a touch I truly appreciated. I also liked that there was extra lettuce to make up for the bun, it is a great touch because it is annoying to pay the same for getting less. It was just juicy and oh so good.  We shared the oxtail fries. They were very good and the portion is very large. In fact, half came home. The meat was tender, flavorful and a nice kick. It was too spicy for my Mom even without the jalapeos but I was happy to finish them off. Next time if I ordered the fried it could be with another side as it was too much food! I want to try the other fries as well, so I will be returning'  I hear it is busy all the time, so as far as service goes I suggest not going at peak service as it is not large, so one may have to wait for excellence.The concrete floors and high ceiling makes it a little noisy but that is also the urban vibe. We had one main server but several different servers and busses came by to make sure we were taken care of!  The is one of the best burgers I have ever had, 5 Stars!
363	0	My wife and I enjoyed the one in New York so we wanted to try this one. The wait was only 20 minutes so it wasn't bad. We have two young boys so we asked if we can have a booth but the hostess said that she didn't have a server. But right after she sat us, she sat three parties into the booths. WTF!? The server that was serving is also serving the booths.  Our food order came out after the two parties that were behind us. My wife ordered the Chinese chicken salad and we got the kids sliders. The food was blah. I probably will not come back.
1794	1	Like most reviews on here, I am gonna go out on a limb and argue that this is probably the BEST Thai restaurant in the US. I completely agree with all of you.   My girlfriend and I came here on our last trip as recommended by yelp, and wow am I glad we tried it. The area didn't exactly look promising, but once we saw the crowd inside, we knew something was up. We knew we were about to have an awesome meal.  Food - We started with the Nam Kao Tod, which is Crispy rice mixed with minced sour sausage, green onion, fresh chili, ginger, peanuts, and lime juice. The spiciness was perfect, although too much for my spice-sensitive gf, but she still enjoyed it enough to brave through it. Yum. 4 out of 5  Then we had the Tom Kha Gai as recommended by the waitress. This is when I knew I had to rave about this place on yelp. The taste was perfect. It was the taste that I would compare all tom kha/yum variations to. Noone else comes close. Seriously. 6 out of 5? lol  Of course, we had to try the Pad Thai. My girlfriend and I always judge the quality of a Thai restaurant based on their pad thai. Why? Because every Thai restaurant has it and it is probably the most popular Thai dish in the US, thus, every Thai restaurant should not only have it, but they better deliver in quality. They did not disappoint. This was the best Pad Thai I've ever had. another 6 out of 5.  Service - our waitress was a Thai lady. She practically recommended all of the dishes we ordered and even recommended which spices to use to bring out the flavor even more. Such a sweet lady =] she got a huge tip :P  Price - It's the price you'd expect to pay at a Thai restaurant.. ;) I'd gladly pay for each dish. Twice.  I need more stars for this place.
308	0	The movie "Harold and Kumar Go to White Castle" was the only reason I wanted to eat White Castle.I waited 11 years to go to White Castle, 11 FREAKING YEARS!!! And I wish I didn't go, totally killed the joy of the movie for me. The sliders are whatever but i guess only good points was the restaurant is still new(ish) and service was great. You want a better burger go find an In'nOut or even Shake Shack which is 10x better.
1364	1	The best KBBQ in Vegas. Literally my first stop every time I visit Las Vegas.   The portion size is quite large for kbbq. You really get the most for your money here. The grill isn't sticky like other places I've been and it isn't smokey.   My favorite dish is the Korean galbi. It's not too salty and has a nice marbling of fat without being fatty. The combination of sweet meats with enoki mushrooms coupled with a sweet onion and perfectly steamed rice keeps me coming back time and time again.   When you've had enough of the overpriced food from the overhyped restaurants on the strip, hop over to gangnam for a great meal the whole family will enjoy at a price that will keep you at the poker table a little longer.
1508	0	If you want deal with a staff who is super hospitable and accommodating but want a room that smells of sweat, weed, and sadness then this is perfect. Our room was "non-smoking" but someone made a filter out of a plastic bag and put it over the smoke detector so they could hot box it. I loved the view outside the hotel but at night the holes in the curtains from critters let the Vegas strip bright lights through to make your room a customized planetarium. Our tub was brown and it would clog every time you would shower. The room decor looked like they found a LOWES going out of business and took all the 2x4 boards and lined the ceiling and made outdated headboards which are great for slamming hookers against. Our safe didn't work but got fixed. I also while taking a nap found a piece of glass in my sheets. I'm praying it's a broken piece of a cocktail glass and not a crack pipe. The water filter behind the ice machine looked like it was last changed when the Dallas Cowboys won a super bowl. The carpets smelled like sweat and were moldy. The restaurant was the best part. Food was hooters food and was done well for what they do. The bar staff was really nice. Overall the hotel was super sketch. If you want to go for an experience and a good story then it's a 10/10. Otherwise pick somewhere else. It always could be worse. I want to reiterate the staff was awesome and a pleasure to deal with.
169	1	Brought a visiting friend here for a relaxed dinner before putting her on the RedEye.  Place was packed early on a Monday, and for good reason.  Absolutely divine.  As other reviewers have mentioned the Crispy Duck Panang is perfection, though, I ordered a level "6" spice and I could have gone up a couple of notches.  Prices are totally reasonable- 2 soup, 2 entree, 4 beers came out to under $70 including tip (and we had leftovers).  Service was prompt but not rushed and very friendly.  Ambiance is somewhat lacking, but food, service and value totally make up the difference.
799	1	Like Johnny Cash, I've been everywhere, man.  I've had PIZZA everywhere, man.  And Secret Pizza is, hands-down, the best pizza I've had ANYWHERE.  A few days ago, my fianc and I got into a random conversation about what we would want to eat for a last meal if we found ourselves on Death Row.  Both of us were kind of stumped.  Now we know.  SECRET PIZZA.  In fact, if Secret Pizza was ONLY served on Death Row, I would commit atrocities against society to get my slice.  I would.  Finding the place was kind of fun.  I had an idea of where it might be based on other Yelp reviews, but I found myself tugging on door handles that do not open and trying to push on panes of glass that looked loose.  I guess I expected it to be so secret that I would have to prove my worth in death-defying feats of strength or manifest the entrance with the power of my mind.  Oh I figured it out alright, but not before I made a total ass of my dorky self in front of lots of scantily-clad club-goers.  My fianc started freaking out first.  For him, it was love at first ooey-gooey sight.  I heard nearby diners launching expletive-laced raves about how it was the best "mo-effin' pizza ever."  Yet, until I took that first bite, I didn't believe.  Now I have seen the light... I have come to Pizza Jesus.  During the entire consumption of my portion of our pie (pepperoni, sausage, and pepperoncini), I giggled like I did on my first date with my fianc.  It was so good that I found it almost hilarious, especially since I just now found this place and I'M MOVING AWAY IN JUNE.  Oh, the cruel, cruel irony.  It's a cold world indeed.  We had plenty of leftovers.  On the way to the car with our ginormous pizza box, my fianc and I argued over how I was apparently "mothering him" by making him hold our precious treasure with two hands.  Maybe he has a point - maybe I need to have a baby to detract from my abnormal attachment to inanimate objects (like pizza).  But I digress.  Oh, and we had to remove a shelf in our fridge to make the box fit.  I'm not even sure it was meant to be removed.  I actually think it's broken now.  Oh well.  It's worth sacrificing the security deposit on our apartment to preserve the pristine state of our perfect pizza.  EDIT:  FYI, the REAL secret of Secret Pizza is that you really need to order the whole pizza so it is fresh and hot.  It isn't nearly as good if you just buy whatever slice is hanging around.  Take my word for it.  Buying the whole pie and having it piping hot takes this pizza from around 3 stars to 5.
1535	1	In my humble foodie opinion, Lotus of Siam has the best Thai food in Vegas and possible in the country (based on their food on the menu, not lunch buffet). How did I reach this conclusion?   - Well let's start with the food itself. The food is phenomenon. I have eaten Thai food in so many places and food at LoS is so much better in term of taste,  flavors, spices, and quality. When I slurped the soup, I could tell the sweetness and flavor came from bones/meat  being stewed for hours, and NOT from loads of MSG many other places threw in to mask the sweetness. They seasoned the food so nicely that your tongue can taste the sourness, sweetness, spiciness and all other flavors at the same time without one overtaking others. The quality is always so fresh.  Food cooked here are truly being made with care and fitted for royalty.   - This restaurant used to be hole in the wall kind of restaurant but since expanded out and lookw much nicer inside. This restaurant is also located in a kinda shading commercial center that you normally would not visit if you're familiar with that area. But guess what?  This restaurant is packed every night and you wouldn't believe how many people took taxi and limousines all the way from the strip to dine at this place. There is usually a line waiting outside even before the restaurant is opened for dinner. If you plan to come late, I recommend getting a reservation ahead of time.  - The chef, Saipin Chutima, has won so many awards and is considered one of the best chefs in the country. The restaurant is Zagat rated and so many celebrities and famous chefs dined at this place.  In term of price, I think they are very reasonable for the quality of food you get here. At least here, you truly get what you pay for, unlike some other crappy places in the strip that charge you an arm and a leg for crappy food.   Don't believe me? Go try their dinner menu and you can see/taste for yourself.
494	0	There isn't really much to say about this place because I didn't enjoy it that much...but I don't really enjoy any buffets outside of vegas and for the price you paid I guess you get that 2 stars. Regardless...you wait in a long line(I'm assuming due to it's cheap price) and you can get a drink...I prefer you not to get a drink because you don't even get to refill it yourself and it's like 1.99 which is alright but flagging down your "waiter/waitress"just to get you another drink is kinda missing the point of Buffet? Anyway I'm not entirely sure on the drinks price but I think my friend paid around $11 for his lunch and soft drink so sounds about right.  Regardless I don't find any of the dishes memorable as they all tasted either too bland or too salty. I honestly don't know if i can really complain about it cause you shouldn't expect much but yea. The memorable part for me is that dessert you get to have cookies and cream, pecan, and 2 other flavors of ice cream and it's unlimited so that's something to look forward to even though it's not the best ice cream you'll ever taste but it certainly beats having only vanilla and chocolate ice cream all the time.  Anyway...my tastebud is spoiled so you can give it a try if you want but I don't see myself coming to this buffet any time soon.
225	0	This place is very very over hyped in my opinion. Came here because most of the buffets in Vegas had already cut off their lines and my friends have been wanting to give it a try. The dining wait was about 45 minutes and by this time, we were all already too hangry to wait so we ordered in the outside togo/patio area instead.   I got myself a bacon cheeseburger and fries. My burger was very bland and had no flavor at all. The meat wasn't even juicy, just dry. :( The fries were mediocre at best. I did try some of my friend's frozen hot chocolate (which is what they're famous for), and it was probably the best thing I had.   Probably best to only grab the frozen hot chocolates here!
274	0	MEH.  I stayed here over labor day weekend (I'm checking out as we speak) and I was not impressed at all. The lobby still looks like it did in the 90s. The gift shop is not remotely up to par with many of the other local hotels. Pretty sure the ugliest shirts ever are sold there and they haven't remodeled since I was 12.  I stayed on the 25th floor. The rooms were updated since the 90s but for some reason they couldn't spend the $20 to cover up the hole between the front door and the carpet.  That being said, I can hear AND feel anytime someone nearby walks by or closes/opens their door. This is absurd for a hotel that is supposedly high end. The doors don't seem to be shut solid so it also shakes anything a door is closed.   So if you need a hotel in Vegas but don't plan on sleeping this is your place to be. Just make sure you don't pay a lot of $ for your room. They don't charge for wifi which is nice at least.
1360	0	I'd like to give it -2 stars. My husband and I were unfortunately awarded 2 free dinners for a Hilton time share tour and we chose this out of three options because we had never tried a Churrascaria. We have friends that have been to Fogo De Choa and although it was pricey, they raved about it. I've eaten with them many times and know their taste. This was not it! Almost all of the meats were overcooked and extremely bland. The salad bar was eh. The staff was completely unengaging. Though we had free tickets, we actually opted to pay an additional $20 a piece so as not to be limited to one meat. It was a complete disappointment. We followed this with another deeply disappointing show with Marc Savard. Just so you don't think we just complain a lot, we immensely enjoyed our meals at Oyster Bay Seafood and Wine Bar and Fix at the Bellagio! And..........Absinthe, is a must SEE!!
502	0	I have eaten at places in Vegas that are pretty bad, but I haven't found a place that serves absolutely inedible food...until last night. The food here is HORRIBLE. I ordered the pad thai...and what do I receive? Something that resembles chinese chow fun, but tastes like plaster. It didn't even remotely taste like pad thai...or chow fun for that matter. My fiancee ordered the char shiu noodle soup. ALSO inedible. The noodles weren't even close to being fully cooked and were still HARD. The broth was sooooo salty...Morton's called them and is asking for their salt back. My friend ordered the chicken fried rice. The rice wasn't even fully steamed before frying so it tasted like pieces of gravel. I can't believe the Bellagio would allow a product like this to be sold on their property. I will never go back again. That place was complete ASS. (and expensive!)  Oh, and no refills on soda? What the hell is that???
745	1	Best steak of my life! I'm not kidding! This place is fantastic- I don't even know where to begin. I didn't think the greens beans would be one of the most memorable parts of my dish. I think it caught me off guard how amazing green beans could taste. The steak is out of this world- it cuts like butter. And there isn't a better way to end your meal than with sticky toffee pudding!
1257	1	Once again, Bachi burger does not disappoint! Today we had the sweet potato fries to start, then the chef's special: Spicy Miso Burger and the Lonely Bird burger.   I almost want to retract my previous review of the Ronin being the Death Row burger. The spicy miso burger is definitely a knife-and-forker. The lonely bird was a picker-upper and held it's own. I swear everytime I come here and think that I had already tried the best burger, something new proves me wrong. Never a dull moment in the food adventure at Bachi Burger. Thanks to Melissa our server today for the recommendation! You guys are awesome!
370	1	Perfection in every way. No, seriously.  We were seated quickly by a friendly hostess and greeted instantly by our waitress who was incredibly kind and checked on us often. I never needed to ask for any refills. SPEAKING OF WHICH, they give you a large container of coffee to help yourself. Amazing for beating that hangover. So is the food. Oh.... The food...  It's great and the menu is HUGE. I enjoyed a veggie omelet while my buddy had French toast stuffed with eggs and cheese. Told you you'd be beating that hangover. The home fries are top notch as well.  I love the table system of alerting the wait staff when you need something. There's a smily face at your table that you simply turn to the frowny side. What a good idea.  Needless to say, I loved it here. I now have a new breakfast spot for my Vegas weekends.

We could hardly find anything we wanted to eat. What we did try was very non-remarkable. Had a couple of decent desserts but as far as the food, BLAH.

Go if you are a fan, go if you enjoy burgers and mostly go if you would ever want a chance to see him. I asked our waiter and he said that Ramsay himself shows up about every 3 weeks. He did mention that there are about 200 people or so who also want a chance to see him-so now you know!  Other than that I do personally recommend that You order your burger medium RARE! The meat is as tender and juicy as it looks in the picture.  The jalapeo shots are a good group appetizer. Yes they are spicy-as they should be!  The order of fries and onion rings are big enough to share with someone else!  Another tip! Before you ever appear on one of his shows Make sure you learn how to cook a scallop and Wellington properly! :p
